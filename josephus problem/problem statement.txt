THE JOSEPHUS PROBLEM 
There are n people standing in a circle waiting to 
be executed. After the first man is executed, k - 1 people are skipped
and the k-th man is executed. 
Then  again, k-1 people are skipped and the  k-th  man  is executed.  
The  elimination  proceeds  around  the  circle  (which  is becoming smaller and smaller 
as the executed people are removed), until only the last man remains, who is given 
freedom. The task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that you survive, 
given n and k.
